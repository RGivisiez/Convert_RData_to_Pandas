# Read a .RData into a pandas data frame

  This notebook was used when I was studying the book Applied Predictive Modeling, this
book uses R as default, so it is necessary to convert .RData to panda if one wants
to use Python.

  Functions and examples on how to open a .RData and return a pandas data frame.


The dataset used can be found here [data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AppliedPredictiveModeling/index.html)
